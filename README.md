# Multi_model-stress-detection-system

This is a multi model stress detection system in which you can predict the stress level using two different models.
The first model is using live face cam which predict the stress level by detecting the facial expressions and analysing it by the help of predefined python libraries.
The second model is about taking some text from the user and predicting the stress level from that.
